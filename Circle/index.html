        <p>You can click on the screen to spawn a circle. 
             This circle will realistically obey Earth-like gravity,
              moving vertically and bouncing upon hitting the bottom of the screen,
              with a dampening effect on each bounce until it comes to a stop. 
              There can be multiple circle instances on screen at a time.
